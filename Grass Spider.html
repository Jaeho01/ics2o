<h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>In my family, I was the one that wanted a computer the most. The biggest thing that I am looking for this purchase is the speed of the computer. I don't mind if it's a desktop or a laptop but I would like a fast computer. Even though my main purpose is school work, I would like a fast computer because when things are slow and laggy, I kind of get mad. My other purposes with the computer are communication with friends or social media. I also would like to play games with my friends in my spare time. The moniter should be not too big but not too small and I would like a quite illuminated keyboard. The mouse should be comfortable in my hand and it shouldn't be loud like the keyboard that I want.</p>

<th>Operating System</th>
<td colspan="2"> Both computers run Windows 10 which is the latest windows to date. I prefer windows over mac or other operating system because I am used to windows. If I switch operating systems, it will take me time to get used to that operating system. I also find windows easy to use than other operating systems. That's why I chose two different computers with windows as their operating system </td>
  
  </table>
<p>In conclusion, I would choose the HP Pavilion 510-P109 Desktop PC. The reasons are because the speed which was my priority is way faster than the laptop. There are disadvantages such as not portable but I think our smartphones will be able to cover most of that. I also beleive that desktops last longer than laptops. So I think that spending a little more money is worth it because the desktop will last longer. I also chose the desktop because I would be able to adjust and fix things. I also prefer a larger display. That's why I chose the desktop over laptop.</p>
