    <p>Since you learned what spam can do, you will want to know how to protect your computer and you. One of the best ways is using a spam filter. A spam filter is a program that is used to detect unsolicited and unwanted email and prevent those messages from getting to a user's inbox. By having this program on your computer, it will prevent most of the spam e-mails from going to your inbox. These spams will be in spam section in your e-mail. Another good thing about this program is that your e-mail account usually has some kind of spam filter. That's why you see 'Spam' in one of the catagories. When you receive a spam mail, the spam filter that is already built in will filter that to the spam section in your e-mail.</p>
