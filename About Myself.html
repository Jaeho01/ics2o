<p><font family:verdana;font-size:5>Hello! My name is Jaeho. I like soccer and I like playing the bass.</font></p>
<center><h2 font color=red>My bass career</h2></center>
<p>When I came to Canada, I started playing the electric bass. I chose bass because I play the guitar and I thought it would be similar to the guitar. I joined junior concert band in grade 7. I like it. In grade 8, I still played bass. I joined senior concert band and I joined the jazz band as well. Throughout the year my music teacher encouraged me to join the OCDSB gr.8 all star jazz band. I auditioned and I made it. It was challenging but it was fun. The next year, I joined junior concert band and the jazz band. And I joined another band called Ottawa Junior Jazz Band. It was challenging but I have improved and it was fun. I also started upright bass in grade 9.  
 In grade 10 I joined senior concert band and I joined the pit band. I am still in the Ottawa Junior Jazz band and I'm having fun. So this is my bass career so far. <center><img src=http://static.zoonar.com/img/www_repository3/7b/a0/20/10_4f67158ac273c829157ff75cde9002f2.jpg></center></p>
