<h3>My Possible Career Path</h3>
	
	<p>I find the arduino most interesting because it's a it has less code than HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also like arduino because I like building the circuits. To get an arduino job in the future, I should take computer science in grade 11 and 12. I think I should also take English, Math, and Physics. Couple programs that I can take at University are COMPUTER SCIENCE (FACULTY OF ENGINEERING), MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE (FACULTY OF SCIENCE), and PHYSICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE. I chose McGill University because that's where I would like to go when I graduate high school. These three programs will help me reach my goal because they are all related to computer science and other things like Math and Physics. I think I should specifically learn more about arduino because that's what I like. The jobs with computer science will decrease because as the technology develops, the computer will be able to do more things which means there will be less jobs for humans. That means I would have to be really good at computer science and I have to really try hard because there will be lots of competition for a job. </p>
