<h1>My Dream Computer</h1>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>In my family, I was the one that wanted a computer the most. The biggest thing that I am looking for this purchase is the speed of the computer. I don't mind if it's a desktop or a laptop but I would like a fast computer. Even though my main purpose is school work, I would like a fast computer because when things are slow and laggy, I kind of get mad. My other purposes with the computer are communication with friends or social media. I also would like to play games with my friends in my spare time. The moniter should be not too big but not too small and I would like a quite illuminated keyboard. The mouse should be comfortable in my hand and it shouldn't be loud like the keyboard that I want.</p>
