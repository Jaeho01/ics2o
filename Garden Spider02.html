Without the network, the user can barely do things except some. Therefore we need to connect ot the internet when we get our computer.</p>

  <li>Plug the wifi modem into a power source</li>
  <li>Turn to modem on and wait it to turn on fully</li>
  <li>Get a ehternet cable and plug one side into one of the ethernet ports on the modem</li>
  <li>Plug the other side of the ethernet cable to the computer's ethernet port</li>
