<h2>Purpose of Spam</h2>
  <p>Spams are sent by spammers who get paid to do all this. Spams could have something simple like an advertisement but it could also have something dangerous like virus. It also could contain alluring contents. They are trying to steal informations from you. Examples of the content could be something like 'You won a lottery' or 'Get a free IPad'. Why would they give free stuff? When you click the link it will tell you to write your personal information and when you write your personal information, the spammer could possibly have access to your bank account and many more things. As you can see, spammers are basically a burglar.</p>
