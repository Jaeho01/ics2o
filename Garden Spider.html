<p>When I get my computer that I chose in the last assignment, I would have to install couple applications to the computer that doesn't come with the computer and I need it.</p>
<br>
The apps I would need to install are:
<ul class="a">
  <li>Facebook</li>
  <li>Google Chrome</li>
</ul>	
<p>I need Facebook because Facebook allows me to socialize with my friends and it also keeps me up to date with social media and what's going in the world. I also need Google Chrome because like I said in the previous assignment, I don't like things slow and I find internet explorer slower than chrome. That's why I want to install chrome on my computer.</p>
