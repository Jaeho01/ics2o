<h1><font color=green>Introduction about myself</font></title>
<p><font size="5">Hello! My name is Jaeho. I like soccer and I like playing the bass.</font></p>
<h2>My bass career</h2>
<p>When I came to Canada, I started playing the electric bass. I chose bass because I play the guitar and I thought it would be similar to the guitar. I joined junior concert band in grade 7. I like it. In grade 8, I still played bass. I joined senior concert band and I joined the jazz band as well. Throughout the year my music teacher encouraged me to join the OCDSB gr.8 all star jazz band. I auditioned and I made it. It was challenging but it was fun. The next year, I joined junior concert band and the jazz band. And I joined another band called Ottawa Junior Jazz Band. It was challenging but I have improved and it was fun. I also started upright bass in grade 9. <center><img src=http://static.zoonar.com/img/www_repository3/7b/a0/20/10_4f67158ac273c829157ff75cde9002f2.jpg></center> 
 In grade 10 I joined senior concert band and I joined the pit band. I am still in the Ottawa Junior Jazz band and I'm having fun. So this is my bass career so far. Image from <a href="http://www.zoonar.com/photo/kontrabass-double-bass_852798.html">Zoonar</a></p>
<h3>Soccer</h3>
<p>One of the hobbies that I like is soccer. I played soccer since I was very young and I find soccer very fun. The club I support is called FC Barcelona <a href>https://www.fcbarcelona.com/</a>. They are one of the best soccer team in the world. <img src=http://www.magazinefuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/9-FC-Barcelona-1024x576.jpg height=400>
