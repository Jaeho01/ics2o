  <p>Like I said before, spam can affect you in different ways. When you make an unwise choice and do what the spam says, you will definitily lose something. You can lose your computer because the spam e-mail can contain virus. That means you might have to do multiple steps to get rid of the virus. But before you realized that there's a virus in your computer, the virus might already done some damage to your computer. Example can be losing your data that was in your computer. The virus also could steal informations from your computer. Depending on which information the virus takes, you can be affected differently. One of the worse case could be virus taking your banking account and you losing a lot of money.</p>
