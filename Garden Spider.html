<h1>How to install application on the computer</h1>
<p>When I get my computer that I chose in the last assignment, I would have to install couple applications to the computer that doesn't come with the computer and I need it.</p>
<br>

The apps I would need to install are:
<ul class="a">
  <li>Facebook</li>
  <li>Google Chrome</li>
</ul>	
<p>I need Facebook because Facebook allows me to socialize with my friends and it also keeps me up to date with social media and what's going in the world. I also need Google Chrome because like I said in the previous assignment, I don't like things slow and I find internet explorer slower than chrome. That's why I want to install chrome on my computer.</p>
  
<h2>How to install the applications</h2>
<ul class="b">
  <li>Turn on the computer</li>
  <li>Connect to the internet (tutorial on the next page)</li>
  <li>Go to google chrome or any other browser</li>
  <li>Go to the <a href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/store/apps/windows>windows app store</a></li>
  <li>Search apps that you want to download</li>
  <li>Click 'get the app' button and download the app</li>
</ul>
